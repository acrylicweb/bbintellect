          ROMANS 1:15-16 (KJV)
          <br /> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
          that are at Rome also. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ:
          for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth;
          to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.",

        In the New Testament, the Greek translation for the gospel is
        ‘Euangelion’, which means “good news”. It is a combination of two Greek
        words, ‘eu’, which means good, and ‘angelion’, which means “messenger or
        message”. This word appears 101 times in the Bible, and in 95 verses in
        the New Testament . . .

        In the New Testament, the Greek translation for the gospel is
        ‘Euangelion’, which means “good news”. It is a combination of two Greek
        words, ‘eu’, which means good, and ‘angelion’, which means “messenger or
        message”. This word appears 101 times in the Bible, and in 95 verses in
        the New Testament. Fundamentally, the gospel of Christ is simply the
        good news or good message of Christ. In the Anglo-Saxon dialect, the
        gospel is translated as ‘godspel’, which can be translated to
        ‘god-story.’ This means that the central theme of the gospel is that it
        proclaims the story of one person: God. <br />
        <br />
        The Gospel is also known as the ‘good tidings’ and/or ‘glad tidings’ in
        the Bible <strong>(See Romans 10:15 & Acts 13:32)</strong>
        . In Greek, “glad tidings” is translated as ‘Euaggelizo’, which means to
        announce good news. This means that when the good news is announced, it
        becomes the glad tidings of Christ. This is why “the gospel” and “glad
        tidings” are sometimes used interchangeably in the Bible. <br />
        <br />
        Although the term ‘gospel’ is found only in the New Testament, the
        concept of proclaiming the good news of God was very prevalent in the
        Old Testament. Interestingly, the gospel is linked to the Greek word
        ‘Evangelion’. In Ancient Greece, an Evangelion was a message of victory.
        The word was originally used to describe a message conveying news about
        a military victory or triumph. In biblical times, when a kingdom
        conquered another on the battlefield, a messenger was sent to announce
        the victory to the inhabitants of the victorious kingdom, who usually
        anticipated the messenger and his message because it brought about
        peace, joy, and celebration. This peace stemmed from the fact that the
        victory won by their army meant the avoidance of the harsh treatment and
        slavery they would have likely received had the rival kingdom bested
        them in battle. This is another reason that the gospel is called the
        gospel of peace in the New Testament{" "}
        <strong>(See Ephesians 6:15).</strong> We see the same concept of this
        good news of triumph with the children of Israel: <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          Awake, awake, Zion, clothe yourself with strength! Put on your
          garments of splendor, Jerusalem, the holy city. The uncircumcised and
          defiled will not enter you again. Shake off your dust; rise up, sit
          enthroned, Jerusalem. Free yourself from the chains on your neck,
          Daughter Zion, now a captive. For this is what the Lord says: “You
          were sold for nothing, and without money you will be redeemed.” For
          this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “At first my people went down to
          Egypt to live; lately, Assyria has oppressed them. “And now what do I
          have here?” declares the Lord. “For my people have been taken away for
          nothing, and those who rule them mock,[a]” declares the Lord. “And all
          day long my name is constantly blasphemed. Therefore my people will
          know my name; therefore in that day they will know that it is I who
          foretold it. Yes, it is I.” How beautiful on the mountains are the
          feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good
          tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, “Your God reigns!”
          (Isaiah 52:1-7) NIV.{" "}
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        This scripture details the prophecy that Isaiah delivered to the
        Israelites during a time of captivity. When the children of Israel were
        held captive in Babylon, this prophecy brought their liberation and
        peace. After years of being forced to accept pagan gods and serve as
        slaves in Babylon, God delivered them through this message of prophecy.
        The message highlighted that God was not going to permit their permanent
        captivity; but rather, the time for their redemption was approaching.
        This was a message of victory and triumph for the Israelites in
        Captivity, and that is why Isaiah called it good news and good tidings.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        From the above illustrations, it can be asserted that the gospel is the
        victorious message of Christ to the entire world. This then begs the
        question, ‘What is the victorious message Christ wants to share with the
        world?’ In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul called the gospel of
        Christ the message of the Cross. This means that whenever the gospel is
        preached, it must reveal the victorious message of the Cross. The cross
        is the message of triumph that Jesus Christ wants humanity to hear.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with
          wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none
          effect. For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
          foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. (1
          Corinthians 1:17-18) KJV.{" "}
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        The chiefest facet of the cross’ importance is that Jesus Christ died
        and shed his blood for humanity upon it. Jesus' death conveys a message
        of victory for many reasons. First, his death brought salvation to those
        who believe. Before being regenerated in Christ, we carried the sinful
        nature within us. We belonged to the kingdom of darkness and were
        separated from a life united with God because of sin. This was a
        consequence of the wages of sin owed to God. These wages led us into a
        life of slavery under Satan’s control. Satan had authority over us.
        However, Jesus set us free from Satan’s power by paying the penalty for
        our transgressions on the cross <strong>
          (See Hebrews 2:14-15).{" "}
        </strong>{" "}
        In fact, the Greek word translated as 'saved' is 'Sozo,’ which also
        means to be delivered from the enemies’ molestation. This message of
        victory and triumph stems from the fact that Jesus’ death on the cross
        marked the victory in the battle against the devil’s power and
        oppression. That is why David in Psalms 20:5 raised a military banner of
        victory to celebrate the prophecy of our salvation, because a battle was
        won for us. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>
          We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will
          set up our banners: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions. (Psalms 20:5)
          KJV.{" "}
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Another reason the cross is a symbol of victory is that it gave us
        triumph over curses under the Law of Moses. In the Bible, the law of
        Moses, also called the Old Covenant, was a major barrier to our
        relationship with God. The Bible tells us that no one could be justified
        by the law because our works could not achieve Righteousness. Because of
        this problem, the law kept humanity guilty before God and brought about
        the consequences of not fulfilling it. It was well-known among the
        Israelites that anyone who broke the law and was worthy of death was
        automatically considered cursed{" "}
        <strong>(See Deuteronomy 21:22-23) </strong>. In fact, humanity was
        cursed because we could not fulfill the law. The devil exploited this
        debt through the Law, constantly keeping us under the power of sin{" "}
        <strong>(See 1 Corinthians 15:56) </strong>. That’s why Jesus came to
        die on the cross. He came to take on this cursed nature on our behalf,
        so that we receive blessings in Christ Jesus{" "}
        <strong>(See Galatians 3:13-14) </strong>. <br />
        <br />
        These and more are the reasons why the gospel is the good news of
        Christ. The victorious message Christ wants to share with humanity is
        that He has eternally redeemed us Himself from the wages of sin and from
        the curses under the Old Covenant. He paid the price for us, so that we
        do not have to suffer for it. Now we are delivered, justified, and
        reconciled back to God by the death of Christ Jesus. This is the
        ultimate good news we preach in Christ Jesus. Amen.
