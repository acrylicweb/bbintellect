          ROMANS 1:15-16 (KJV)
          <br /> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
          that are at Rome also. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ:
          for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth;
          to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.",

        In the New Testament, the Greek translation for the gospel is
        ‘Euangelion’, which means “good news”. It is a combination of two Greek
        words, ‘eu’, which means good, and ‘angelion’, which means “messenger or
        message”. This word appears 101 times in the Bible, and in 95 verses in
        the New Testament . . .

      "In the New Testament, the Greek translation for the gospel is ‘Euangelion’, which means “good news”. It is a combination of two Greek words, ‘eu’, which means good, and ‘angelion’, which means “messenger or message”. This word appears 101 times in the Bible, and in 95 verses in the New Testament. Fundamentally, the gospel of Christ is simply the good news or good message of Christ. In the Anglo-Saxon dialect, the gospel is translated as ‘godspel’, which can be translated to ‘god-story.’ This means that the central theme of the gospel is that it proclaims the story of one person: God. \n \n The Gospel is also known as the ‘good tidings’ and/or ‘glad tidings’ in the Bible (See    Romans 10:15 & Acts 13:32). In Greek, “glad tidings” is translated as ‘Euaggelizo’, which means to announce good news. This means that when the good news is announced, it becomes the glad tidings of Christ. This is why “the gospel” and “glad tidings” are sometimes used interchangeably in the Bible.",

      "Although the term ‘gospel’ is found only in the New Testament, the concept of proclaiming the good news of God was very prevalent in the Old Testament. Interestingly, the gospel is linked to the Greek word ‘Evangelion’. In Ancient Greece, an Evangelion was a message of victory. The word was originally used to describe a message conveying news about a military victory or triumph. In biblical times, when a kingdom conquered another on the battlefield, a messenger was sent to announce the victory to the inhabitants of the victorious kingdom, who usually anticipated the messenger and his message because it brought about peace, joy, and celebration. This peace stemmed from the fact that the victory won by their army meant the avoidance of the harsh treatment and slavery they would have likely received had the rival kingdom bested them in battle. This is another reason that the gospel is called the gospel of peace in the New Testament (See Ephesians 6:15). We see the same concept of this good news of triumph with the children of Israel:\n \n Awake, awake, Zion, clothe yourself with strength! Put on your garments of splendor, Jerusalem, the holy city. The uncircumcised and defiled will not enter you again. Shake off your dust; rise up, sit enthroned, Jerusalem. Free yourself from the chains on your neck, Daughter Zion, now a captive. For this is what the Lord says: “You were sold for nothing, and without money you will be redeemed.” For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “At first my people went down to Egypt to live; lately, Assyria has oppressed them. “And now what do I have here?” declares the Lord. “For my people have been taken away for nothing, and those who rule them mock,[a]” declares the Lord. “And all day long my name is constantly blasphemed. Therefore my people will know my name; therefore in that day they will know that it is I who foretold it. Yes, it is I.” How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, “Your God reigns!” (Isaiah 52:1-7) NIV.",

      "This scripture details the prophecy that Isaiah delivered to the Israelites during a time of captivity. When the children of Israel were held captive in Babylon, this prophecy brought their liberation and peace. After years of being forced to accept pagan gods and serve as slaves in Babylon, God delivered them through this message of prophecy. The message highlighted that God was not going to permit their permanent captivity; but rather, the time for their redemption was approaching. This was a message of victory and triumph for the Israelites in Captivity, and that is why Isaiah called it good news and good tidings.\n \n From the above illustrations, it can be asserted that the gospel is the victorious message of Christ to the entire world. This then begs the question, ‘What is the victorious message Christ wants to share with the world?’ In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul called the gospel of Christ the message of the Cross. This means that whenever the gospel is preached, it must reveal the victorious message of the Cross. The cross is the message of triumph that Jesus Christ wants humanity to hear.",

      "For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. (1 Corinthians 1:17-18) KJV.\n \n The chiefest facet of the cross’ importance is that Jesus Christ died and shed his blood for humanity upon it. Jesus' death conveys a message of victory for many reasons. First, his death brought salvation to those who believe. Before being regenerated in Christ, we carried the sinful nature within us. We belonged to the kingdom of darkness and were separated from a life united with God because of sin. This was a consequence of the wages of sin owed to God. These wages led us into a life of slavery under Satan’s control. Satan had authority over us. However, Jesus set us free from Satan’s power by paying the penalty for our transgressions on the cross (See Hebrews 2:14-15). In fact, the Greek word translated as 'saved' is 'Sozo,’ which also means to be delivered from the enemies’ molestation. This message of victory and triumph stems from the fact that Jesus’ death on the cross marked the victory in the battle against the devil’s power and oppression. That is why David in Psalms 20:5 raised a military banner of victory to celebrate the prophecy of our salvation, because a battle was won for us.\n \n We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions. (Psalms 20:5) KJV.",

      "Another reason the cross is a symbol of victory is that it gave us triumph over curses under the Law of Moses. In the Bible, the law of Moses, also called the Old Covenant, was a major barrier to our relationship with God. The Bible tells us that no one could be justified by the law because our works could not achieve Righteousness. Because of this problem, the law kept humanity guilty before God and brought about the consequences of not fulfilling it. It was well-known among the Israelites that anyone who broke the law and was worthy of death was automatically considered cursed (See Deuteronomy 21:22-23). In fact, humanity was cursed because we could not fulfill the law. The devil exploited this debt through the Law, constantly keeping us under the power of sin (See 1 Corinthians 15:56). That’s why Jesus came to die on the cross. He came to take on this cursed nature on our behalf, so that we receive blessings in Christ Jesus (See Galatians 3:13-14). \n \n These and more are the reasons why the gospel is the good news of Christ. The victorious message Christ wants to share with humanity is that He has eternally redeemed us Himself from the wages of sin and from the curses under the Old Covenant. He paid the price for us, so that we do not have to suffer for it. Now we are delivered, justified, and reconciled back to God by the death of Christ Jesus. This is the ultimate good news we preach in Christ Jesus. Amen.",
